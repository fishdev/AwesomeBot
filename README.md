# AwesomeBot

*This is the home for the bot that once was the best Discord bot. When AwesomeBot was officially murdered by its evil creator, the (very lazy) development team was in the middle of working on the next version of the project, Neo (v4). It was near-completion but had some major bugs and didn't work for large bots. This repo hosts the work-in-progress AwesomeBot version 4 code, for your personal ~~enjoyment~~. You're absolutely free to do whatever the hell you want with this code, just please don't complain to me about how horrible it is or expect me to maintain or host it in any way.*
